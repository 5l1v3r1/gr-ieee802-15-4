This is a simple IEEE802.15.4 implementation for GNU Radio v3.6.3, based on the UCLA transceiver (https://cgran.org/wiki/UCLAZigBee). Currently, it features very basic, separated rx and tx chains (-> examples folder).

In the contiki folder you find a Contiki(v2.6) firmware that I used to test interoperability with TelosB motes. There is also another README file that shows how to use the firmware.

INSTALLATION
============
git clone git://github.com/bastibl/gr-ieee802-15-4.git
cd gr-ieee802-15-4
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig


USAGE
===========
Open tx.grc / rx.grc in gnuradio-companion.
You can connect to the rx and tx flow graph with netcat to send packets or see the received payload, respectively.

nc -u localhost 52001
