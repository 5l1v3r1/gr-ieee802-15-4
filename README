Hi!

This is a simple IEEE802.15.4 implementation for GNU Radio v3.6.4. Currently, it features are very basic, separated rx and tx chains. In the contiki folder you find a Contiki firmware for TelosB motes that I used to test interoperability. For installation see the README in the contiki folder.

INSTALLATION
============
git clone git://github.com/bastibl/gr-ieee802-15-4.git
cd gr-ieee802-15-4
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install


USAGE
===========
Open tx.grc / rx.grc in gnuradio-companion.
