Hi!

This is an IEEE802.15.4 transceiver for GNU Radio v3.6.4. It is based on the UCLA implementation (https://cgran.org/wiki/UCLAZigBee) of Thomas Schmid.

Currently, it features a transceiver, separated rx and tx chains, and a loopback flow graph to test it without any hardware (see the examples folder).

You can find the firmware that I used to test interoperability with TelosB motes in the contiki folder. The firmware is based on Contiki(v2.6). There is another README file in the contiki folder that describes how to use the firmware.

INSTALLATION
============
git clone git://github.com/bastibl/gr-ieee802-15-4.git
cd gr-ieee802-15-4
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig


USAGE
===========
Open a flow graph from the examples folder in GNU Radio Companion. You can connect to the Socket PDU blocks of the flow graph with netcat to send and receive packets. Just open a terminal and type

nc -u localhost 52001

Have fun!
